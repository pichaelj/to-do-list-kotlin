# to-do-list-kotlin
Creating a todo list in kotlin as i try to learn all architecture components
For my first Kotlin project, I am going to create a to do list.
The fun part is i will keep modifying this project as i learn every architecture component
By the time i finish, it will have the MVVM architecture. 

Enjoy
